## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a serverless contact form solution using AWS services. The contact form is hosted on Amazon S3 as a static website, and when a user submits the form, it triggers an API Gateway endpoint, which invokes a Lambda function to send an email via Amazon SES.

This solution is:
- **Cost-effective**: You only pay for what you use
- **Scalable**: Can handle varying loads automatically
- **Secure**: Uses AWS IAM for permissions
- **Maintenance-free**: No servers to manage

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AWS account
- AWS Management Console access
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Basic understanding of AWS services
- AWS CLI installed (optional but recommended)

## Architecture Overview

Here's how the components work together:

1. User visits the contact form hosted on **Amazon S3**
2. User fills out and submits the form
3. Form submission sends a request to **API Gateway**
4. API Gateway triggers the **Lambda function**
5. Lambda function uses **Amazon SES** to send an email with the form data
6. Response is returned to the user

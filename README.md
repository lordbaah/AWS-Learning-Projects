# 🌩️ AWS Learning Projects – Azubi Africa Training

This repository contains AWS cloud projects I completed as part of my 18-week training program with **Azubi Africa**, in collaboration with **Generation Ghana** and **Mastercard Foundation**.

The projects range from basic foundational concepts like VPCs and EC2 setups, to more advanced architectures involving **Load Balancing**, **Auto Scaling**, and **Database deployments**

Each project is clearly documented with architecture diagrams, deployment steps, screenshots, and code or configuration files where necessary.
